                A significant amount of data is gathered on college premises
                including tracking faculty and student attendance,
                transportation information, and outside visitors. This data
                needs to be gathered and maintained. Traditional methods include
                having a designated authorized person manually record it. This
                can be a difficult task at times, and a lot of time is wasted.
                To solve this issue, we are developing an application that can
                store it effectively and assist us in retrieving the important
                data that is being generated and can be utilized for a variety
                of different purposes. The system created could use scanner
                machines to automatically fetch the data, which could then be
                fed into the system and the application created is
                user-friendly.

                "Gate pass management and monitoring system using Raspberry Pi"
                is being developed to solve the problem of the existing manual
                entering system. In any organization, authentication of the
                people is the priority of the organization. In any organization,
                the flow of people is to a great extent which could include
                students and lecturers moving in and out, and visitors entering
                the premises all the movements should be handled efficiently. To
                overcome the problems of manual entry system which could have
                problems such as an error in filling details, losing of
                registers where the data was stored, etc. Gate pass management
                and monitoring system help to solve problems efficiently. This
                system is designed in such a manner that the person entering the
                details does not require any formal knowledge. The interface is
                user-friendly where only necessary data is stored.<br /><br />
                The system is being built in such a way that it tries to avoid
                generating any errors. The system also provides error messages
                when invalid data is entered. The system created is error-free,
                secure, and reliable. Log files can be generated whenever any
                information is required for verifying the data. A gate pass
                management system is an important tool for ensuring the security
                and safety of any secured area. By allowing only authorized
                individuals to enter and exit the area, it helps to prevent
                unauthorized access.
                <br /><br />
                One of the key features of a gate pass management system is to
                store data of people visiting the college. This system generally
                stores an individual's name, photo, and the reason for their
                visit, as well as the duration of their access. This information
                allows the gate pass management system to monitor and control
                access to the secured area, ensuring that only those with a
                valid gate pass are allowed entry. In addition to controlling
                access, a gate pass management system can also be used to
                generate reports and logs of all access activity. This provides
                a record of who has entered and exited the secured area, which
                can be helpful for security purposes and for tracking the
                movement of individuals within the area.<br /><br />
                We have created a QR Code Scanner which is built using Raspberry
                Pi whenever a student enters a college his CollegeId is scanned
                and if it matches with the records in the database the LED light
                blinks and the timings of the particular student is stored is in
                cloud and if the id doesn’t match with the database the LED
                doesn’t blink which means it is not present in the database.
                <br /><br />
                Another benefit of a gate pass management system is that it can
                help to improve the overall efficiency and organization of the
                secured area. By streamlining the process of granting access to
                authorized individuals, the gate pass management system can help
                reduce congestion and improve traffic flow in and out of the
                area. This can help to improve the overall experience of those
                visiting the secured area. Overall, a gate pass management
                system is an essential tool for ensuring the security and safety
                of any secured area. By controlling access and providing a
                record of access activity, the gate pass management system can
                help to prevent unauthorized access and improve the overall
                efficiency and organization of the secured area.

                Prof. Archana S. Banait et al. proposed a system to track the
                data of the students, faculty and visitor’s info using the RFID
                reader and card and here if any visitors come the faculty need
                to approve it and everything will be stored in the database.[1]
                <br /><br />
                Norizan Anwar et al. proposed the model UTAUT to determine the
                acceptance of visitor. The main main of this project was knowing
                the visitors where they are.[2] <br /><br />
                S. Junaida et al. developed a VIMS Application and Design. This
                captures new visiting record and assignment of visitor pass.
                Visitor’s information in a database server in a particular

                Prof. Abhay Gaidhani et al. paper aims for Gate pass using
                Raspberry Pi. The motto of this paper was to save paper and use
                technology like sending email and sms.[4] <br /><br />
                Romy Jun A. Sunico et al. proposed a system which was able to
                track the monitoring of students,visitors and employees entering
                the college.The system's planning, design, creation,
                deployment,and testing all followed the Rapid Application
                Development (RAD) Model. Additionally,software like XAMPP,
                MySQL, and PHP were used to create and implement the system. The
                system developed had helped in monitoring who passed through the
                premises and thus for the administration, this approach assisted
                in generating feedback.[7]
                <br /><br />
                Divya Gaur et al. proposed a system which made it possible to
                keep track of entry and exit actions inside the specified
                premises efficiently and precisely. Since pen and paper could be
                problematic for both visitors and the security staff, this
                approach has helped eliminate their use.Recording all the
                necessary data becomes simple if the administrator could learn
                how to manage the system. The primary goal was to make the
                administrator or appropriate authority's interface simple to
                use.[8] <br /><br />
                Yogesh S. Watile et.al in their work suggested a "Security
                System for Industrial Gate And Generation of GatePass" . From
                digital photos, the face recognition system automatically helps
                in the identification and authentication of people. The PCA
                technique was used to detect the face, extract its features, and
                compare it to the existing database. The gate will open if the
                face matches the existing database, and a gate pass will be
                automatically generated if an unauthorized person is
                recognized.[9]<br /><br />
                Mr. M. Santhanaraj M.E. et.al in their work suggested a system
                "Digital Gate Pass System Using Hybrid Application" . It
                comprises a web application that security personnel, students,
                and concerned HODs can use. The interface includes time
                intervals and the reasons for exit, which are both stored in the
                database. In this approach, students apply for exit with
                reasons, the HOD reviews it from a different application
                interface, and after approval, it is transferred to a personal
                security interface where the approval can be viewed. HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and for server communication in this system,PHP are
                used. A Cordova plugin is used to package the entire system into
                an app. This system makes student exits more effective.[10]
                <br /><br />
                Dr.S. Kanaga Suba Raja et.al proposed a system "Offline Security
                Gate Operation In (ICMS) Identity Card Management System Using
                Aadhaar ID". The proposed system enables authentication to be
                registered with the Aadhaar id, validated and proper
                identification to be done in a secured way for entry/exit
                purposes. Aadhar Id is integrated with visitor pass management
                for appointment, data is stored in local database and in offline
                security it helps us easy to verify.When a person comes with
                unique identification,offline access at the gate becomes easy as
                only identification is required which reduces manpower and high
                cost.[13] <br /><br />
                S. Emima Princy et al. recommended a method in their paper
                titled "Implementation of Cloud Server for Real Time Data
                Storage using Raspberry Pi." A Raspberry Pi can be configured to
                function as a private cloud server, which can be utilized as a
                storage device for applications using real-time signals. Using
                cloud platforms offered by particular cloud vendors, Raspberry
                Pi is a less expensive microprocessor in which cloud computing
                infrastructure can be achieved. The Raspberry Pi can be used as
                a cloud server that stores data for real-time applications.[14]

                using barcode scanner. Raspberry pi checks with the database and
                if it matches with the database a LED blink happens which means
                it is successful and student can enter the college and if it
                doesn't match then the LED doesn't blink.<br /><br />
                Another benefit of using cloud storage for barcode scanning is
                that it allows for easy sharing of data. With traditional
                storage methods, data might be stored in a central location and
                accessed by a limited number of people. With cloud storage, data
                can be shared with multiple users, making it easier for teams to
                collaborate and work together.

              <p align="justify">
                A dynamic website is built for a designated person at the gate
                to monitor the inflow. This website is designed using HTML, CSS,
                Bootstrap, and JavaScript.[7] This website has different
                components i.e Student Data Entry, Faculty Data Entry, Visitor's
                Data Entry, Student's Data Report, Faculty Data Report,
                Visitor's Data Report, and College Transportation Raspberry
                Data.<br /><br />
                The website has to logins. The admin login and the security
                log-in the security will be scanning the id of the student who
                ever comes late. The scanning will be done by a pi attached to
                it, and the data will be saved in the cloud and that is attached
                to the database. Then here the admin logins can view who has
                come late daily and they will be having logs day by day and
                department-wise also.[10] If the student comes more than one
                time late to college besides his roll number there will be a
                frequency count so that the admins can easily see how many times
                did the student come late. In this way, faculties are also done.
                If the visitor comes generally, we will be writing every data
                manually to reduce the paperwork we generated.[8]<br /><br />
                Here if any visitor comes to the college first, we will be
                taking the phone number and verify if he is a new user or an
                existing user, if he is a new user we will be taking all the
                details like to whom they are visiting, with how many people
                they have come, what is the purpose of the visit and why are
                they visiting the college. If the phone number is already
                registered just we will be taking to whom they are visiting.[9]
                Coming to transportation, generally, our security guards will
                note down the details of the bus at what time the bus is
                entering the college and at what time it is exiting the college
                and they will be making the note of the kilometre reading every
                day so that's the huge task so we have made it simple using this
                application just we need to select the bus number and click on
                submit the log data will be stored in the database. And finally,
                we can view the report of each and everything in detail.[14] So
                this makes easy to everyone and if issue comes, we can easily
                fetch data and sort out the problem. Fig 1 represents the
                architecture diagram of the system.

                Gate Pass Management and Monitoring System was constructed in
                order to help us identify people who were entering late to the
                college premises. Every faculty and student had a College Id,
                which included a distinctive QR Code with information specific
                to each group.[11].<br /><br />
                A Raspberry Pi-connected QR Code Scanner was used to scan each
                person as they entered thecampus. The generated data was
                uploaded to the cloud for storage. The generated data is saved
                in the database according to several parameters, which may
                comprise multiple departments.[13]<br /><br />
                The entry time of the student was also kept in this database,
                which is highly useful information that allows us to create log
                files that allow us to know the student's analysis in depth,HOD
                and admins can view this information.[12]<br /><br />

              <p align="justify">
                One potential area for future development in the field of gate
                pass management systems is the integration of advanced
                technology such as biometric authentication and facial
                recognition. This could allow for more secure and reliable
                methods of identifying and verifying the identity of individuals
                seeking access to the secured area.<br /><br />
                Another potential area of future development is the integration
                of gate pass management systems with other security systems,
                such as CCTV cameras and alarm systems. This could allow for a
                more comprehensive and coordinated approach to security,
                providing real-time monitoring and response to potential
                security threats.<br /><br />
                Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence and machine
                learning algorithms could be explored to improve the efficiency
                and accuracy of gate pass management systems. For example, these
                technologies could analyze access logs and identify patterns and
                trends that could indicate potential security risks.<br /><br />
                Overall, there is great potential for future development and
                innovation in the field of gate pass management systems. By
                leveraging advanced technology and integrating with other
                security systems, gate pass management systems could become even
                more effective in ensuring the security and safety of secured
                areas.
